# Advent of Code 2024

This year I set this up to work on Elixir and Ruby.
However, I'm focusing on Ruby first so that I can refresh my Ruby brain.
It's been a few years since I've crafted Ruby and I want to get back into it.
As I have time I'll be adding in Elixir solutions.
In theory they won't take as much time since my Exlixir is extremely fresh and I will have a reference solution in Ruby.
